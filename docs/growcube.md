### **Installation**

#### **Steps To Use GrowCube**

1. Install the filter, install the filter at the water inlet of the water tank, and insert it vertically as shown in the figure right. 
![Install the filter.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Install_the_filter.png/500px-Install_the_filter.png){ loading=lazy }

2. Connect the soil moisture sensor to the GrowCube and insert the other end into the soil. There are four sensor interfaces(Marked A to D) on the GrowCube, and you can connect a sensor to any one of them. For example, when using port a to water plants, connect the sensor to port A of the GrowCube(Pay attention to the buckle position of the sensor connector and device interface). Then insert the soil moisture sensor vertically into the soil, the insertion depth should be more than 2/3 of the sensor, and the sensor insertion position should be as close as possible to the rhizome of the plant.

### **Network Configuration**

The GrowCube has two working modes, **Networking Mode** and **Direct Connection Mode**. We recommend users to use the networking mode, which is connected to the router wifi at home or the wifi in the office environment, the device and the mobile phone can establish a local area network connection. Multiple devices can be added this way. Of course, if you are in an environment without WiFi, you can also use direct connection mode. The device itself will open access point, allowing the phone to connect directly. In direct connection mode, only one device can be controlled at the same time and only locally stored plants can be added instead of using the cloud database.

#### **Networking Mode**

Before configuring the network for the GrowCube, let's take a look at how GrowCube Networking Mode works:    
![Network.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Network.png/700px-Network.png){ loading=lazy }   
The GrowCube is connected through the home / office WiFi network, it is the intermediary between mobile phone and GrowCube information transmission.   
**Here are the steps for GrowCube to configure the network:**  

- 1. Open the app and enter the <font color="green">**Mode Selection**</font> page, select **"Networking Mode"** and enter the  <font color="green">**Set GrowCube Network**</font> 'page, enter the home/office WiFi name and home/office WiFi password to be used, click **"Continue"**, and there will be a pop-up "XXXX (your WiFi name) has been Saved";

**Note:**  There is a drop-down selection menu at the WiFi name, users can choose WiFi by themselves, the recently used WiFi will be displayed first, <font color="red">do not use 5G network as it is currently not supported.</font>
