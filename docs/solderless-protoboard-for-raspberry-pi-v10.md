title: Solderless Protoboard for raspberry pi v1.0
---

## **Introduction**
----------------

This a solderless protoboard for raspberry pi,it have a printed circuit board and a single 2\*20 GPIO header for raspberry pi to put your Perma-Proto on top of you Raspberry Pi. This version also comes with a 24C32 I2C EEPROM soldered on and connected to the EEDAT/EECLK lines. Nearly every pin you could want to connect to the pin are drawn out(Except for #26). You can easily insert the components on the breadboard and connect to raspberry pi to do a variety of interesting experiments.

**Model: (Discontinued)**
