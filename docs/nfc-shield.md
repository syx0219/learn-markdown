title: NFC shield
---

## Introduction
------------

The NFC(Near Field Communications) Shield uses a highly integrated transceiver module PN532 which handles contactless communication at 13.56MHz. With the arduino library, you can read and write a 13.56MHz tag with this shield or implement point to point data exchange with two NFC Shields. This shield is designed to use SPI communication protocols. you can choose the PD9 or PD10 as SS pin. so it can be used compatible with more Arduino Shields which also uses the SPI communication protocal.

![connect](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/thumb/6/6f/NFC_Shield1.jpg/400px-NFC_Shield1.jpg){ loading=lazy }

- Compile and upload the example sketch provided.

### Programming

Donwload the [PN532\_SPI Library For NFC Shield](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/8/84/PN532_SPI.zip) and install it to \\arduino\\libraries. you can either copy the folling codes into Arduino IDE or open Open the examples in the library to start.
**Demo 1ï¼šRead the complete memory of a MIFARE card**
1\. Open and upload the example **readAllMemoryBlocks** example as show below.

**This sketch reads the complete memory of a MIFARE Standard card using default authentication keys. The output gives typical memory layout of fresh MIFARE Standard card.**

2\. Bring a Mifare Card near the NFC Antenna ON PCB.

**Note:** Blocks are classified as Manufacturer Block(read-only), Data Block (user/application writable area), and Sector Trailer(authentication and access bits for that sector)

3.Open the serial monitor, you can see the score as shown below:

**Demo 2: Write data to MIFARE Memory Block**

1\. Open the example **writeMifareMemory**. This example writes a MIFARE memory block 0x08 of a new MIFARE 1K cards using default authentication keys .Read the Block Memory after complete writing data to MIFARE Memory Block.

**Note:** Memory block 0 is readonly and contains manufacturer data. Do not write to Sector Trailer block unless you know what you are doing. Otherwise, the MIFARE card may be unusable in the future.

2\. Compile and upload the example.

3\. Bring a Mifare Card near the NFC Antenna.   
4\. Open the serial monitor, you can see the score as show below:

## Reference code
--------------

The APIs make use of the commands to invoke the interfaces provided by PN532 firmware via SPI. All these commands are documented in PN532 User Manual. The following APIs are provided by PN532\_SPI Library.


**boolean SAMConfig(void)**

This API invokes the **SAMConfiguration** command of PN532 and sets it to **Normal Mode**. **SAM** stands for Security Access Module (i.e the PN532 system). PN532 system can work in **Normal** mode, **Virtual Card** mode, **Wired Card** mode and **Dual Card** mode.

**Usage**:

```
nfc.SAMConfig(); // Call this before any read/write operation
```


**uint32\_t readPassiveTargetID(uint8\_t cardbaudrate)**

This method reads the Passive Target ID and returns it as a 32-bit number. At the moment only reading MIFARE ISO14443A cards/tags are supported. Hence use **PN532\_MIFARE\_ISO14443A** as parameter. *Returns* 32 bit card number

**Usage**:

```
uint32_t cid;
// look for MiFare type cards/tags
cid = nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A);
```

**uint32\_t authenticateBlock(uint8\_t cardnumber, uint32\_t cid, uint8\_t blockaddress ,uint8\_t authtype, uint8\_t \* keys)**

This method is used to authenticate a memory block with key before read/write operation. *Returns* **true** when successful.

- **cardnumber** can be 1 or 2
- **cid** is 32-bit Card ID
- **blockaddress** is block number (any number between 0 - 63 for MIFARE card)
- **authtype** is which key is to be used for authentication (either **KEY\_A** or **KEY\_B**)
- **keys** points to the byte-array holding 6 keys.

**Usage:**

```
uint8_t keys[]= {0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF,0xFF};  // default key of a fresh card
nfc.authenticateBlock(1, id ,3,KEY_A,keys); ////authenticate block 3, id is 32-bit passive target id.
```

**uint32\_t readMemoryBlock(uint8\_t cardnumber,uint8\_t blockaddress, uint8\_t \* block)**

This method reads a memory block after authentication with the key. *Returns* **true** when successful.

- **cardnumber** can be 1 or 2
- **blockaddress** is block number (any number between 0 - 63 for MIFARE card) to read. Each block is 16bytes long in case of MIFARE Standard card.
- **block** points to buffer(byte-array)to hold 16 bytes of block-data.

**Usage:**

```
uint8_t block[16];
nfc.readMemoryBlock(1,3,block); //Read can be performed only when authentication was successful.
```

**uint32\_t writeMemoryBlock(uint8\_t cardnumber,uint8\_t blockaddress, uint8\_t \* block)**

This method writes data to a memory block after authentication with the key. *Returns* **true** when successful.

- **cardnumber** can be 1 or 2
- **blockaddress** is block number (any number between 0 - 63 for MIFARE card) to write. Each block is 16bytes long in case of MIFARE Standard card.
- **block** points to buffer(byte-array) which holds 16 bytes of block-data to write.**Usage:**

```
uint8_t writeBuffer[16];
    for(uint8_t ii=0;ii<16;ii++)
     { 
       writeBuffer[ii]=ii; //Fill buffer with 0,1,2....F
     }
nfc.writeMemoryBlock(1,0x08,writeBuffer); //Write writeBuffer[] to block address 0x08. Read can be performed only when authentication was successful.
```

**uint32\_t PN532::configurePeerAsInitiator(uint8\_t baudrate)**

This method implements a Peer to Peer Initiator. *Returns* **true** when successful.

- **baudrate** can be any number from 0-2. 0 for 106kbps or 1 for 201kbps or 2 for 424kbps. At the moment only 1 and 2 are supported.

**This feature is experimental and supports NFC Peer to Peer communication with other NFC shields. Interaction with mobile devices are not tested.**

**Usage:**

         Serial.print("Data Sent and Received: ");
         Serial.println(DataIn);
        }
    }
