title: Crowbits-Hall Sensor
---

## Description
-----------

The hall sensor is a digital input module that is used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field, it converts the change of magnetic field into a change in output voltage.

## Features
--------

- Digital input module
- Easy to use
- High sensitivity

## Specification
-------------

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V DC
- Supply mode: Crowbits Power Module
- Dimensions: 31.5(L)\*24.5(W)\*13(H) mm

## Usage
-----

1\. You also need to prepare a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply, and an output module, such as Crowbits-LED.

2\. The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.
