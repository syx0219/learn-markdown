## Features
--------

- Digital input module

## Specification
-------------

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V DC
- Supply mode: Crowbits Power Module

## Usage
-----

1\. You also need to prepare a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply, and an output module, such as Crowbits-LED.

2\. The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.
