3.Copy the demo code to your sketch, then upload to Arduino or Crowduino board.You will see the LED blink every second.

```
#define LED 5 //connect LED to digital pin5
void setup() {                
 // initialize the digital pin5 as an output.
 pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);     
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);   // set the LED on
 delay(500);               // for 500ms
 digitalWrite(LED, LOW);   // set the LED off
 delay(500);
}
```
