## **FAQs**
--------

**1. Unable to boot**  
1. Make sure you are using the correct charger and you inserted the SD card into the Raspberry Pi
2. Re-format and re-flash the SD/TF card. After booting the CrowPi L, use Gparted to resize the partition /dev/mmcblk0p2 where the image of CrowPi L is installed. For details, please refer to Step5 on [this page ](https://forum.elecrow.com/discussion/302/how-to-download-crowpi-l-os-image/p1?new=1).

**2. The wireless mouse cannot be used**  
Please ensure that the battery is sufficient and the wireless receiver has been inserted into the USB port of the Raspberry Pi  

**3. The touchpad cannot be used**  
Please confirm that the touch function (keyboard touch function switch: FN+F1) is turned on

**4. The screen is black and freezes**  
Please check whether the high-current peripherals were mounted and led to insufficient power supply. It may also due to standby caused by long periods of non-use, use a touchpad or keyboard to wake up

**5.The camera and microphone do not work**   
The USB adapter connection is unstable, please re-plug

**6. Unable to connect to the network**  
Please turn on the wireless network or connect to the Raspberry Pi Ethernet port. 

**7. How to show battery status in the system tray of the native Raspberry Pi OS**  
Here's a little app to show the battery status: [https://github.com/ppyne/crowPi-L\_BatteryStatus](https://github.com/ppyne/crowPi-L_BatteryStatus)  
For details, please refer to [this page](https://forum.elecrow.com/discussion/295/show-battery-status-of-crowpi-l-in-raspberry-pi-os#latest).
