1.Open your .PCB design files on Altium designer software, check the integrity of the files. Here used an example .PcbDoc file as an example.

Left-click the “ok”, then most of the gerber file are generated in your design file folder.

We suggest to select Inches and leading zeros, this way will increase the accuracy. Left-click the “ok” then a complete gerber file was finished.
