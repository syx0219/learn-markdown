## **HMI (human-machine interface)**
-----

HMI (Human-Machine Interface) refers to the interface that interacts between humans and machines or equipment through software and hardware. It can help people easily grasp the running status of machines or equipment, control their execution actions, etc., making human-computer interaction simpler and more intuitive. HMI is commonly used in industrial and automation control systems to monitor and control production processes and equipment. The components of HMI include: display, touch screen, control buttons, indicator lights, alarm system, data transmission interface, etc. In terms of software, HMI is mainly composed of human-computer interaction interface, control logic program, communication protocol and so on. Users can control the running status of the equipment through the touch screen, control buttons and other operation interfaces, and at the same time observe the feedback information such as the running status of the equipment. The advantage of HMI is that it can make the control system more efficient, accurate, and reliable, while saving human resources and time costs. HMIs are also often used in home automation systems, such as smart home control panels, to allow occupants to control home devices more conveniently. In short, HMI is an interface that realizes the interaction between human and machine or equipment through the combination of software and hardware. It can help users better grasp and control the operating status of equipment, and improve work efficiency and performance.

## **Summarize**
------

In the first lesson, we learned the basic concepts and applications of the Human Machine Interface (HMI), while introducing the related ESP32 terminal screen family. We also learned how to configure the Arduino environment, which is an important step in the development of ESP32, which provides us with a convenient development platform. By using these screens and the related software environment, we can easily develop various graphical interfaces and user interfaces. In the following lessons, we will learn more deeply how to use various software and ESP32 to build various applications, so as to achieve richer and more complex functions.
