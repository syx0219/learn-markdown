## **Introduction to Widgets**
-----

LVGL is a lightweight, flexible, and cross-platform GUI library designed to provide efficient graphical user interfaces. It supports multiple operating systems and platforms, including embedded systems (such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi) and desktop systems (such as Windows and Linux). LVGL's API is simple and easy to use, providing many widgets and features that can help developers create beautiful and responsive user interfaces quickly. LVGL's widgets are highly customizable and can be configured in terms of size, shape, color, font, and icon to adapt to different application scenarios and user needs. LVGL also provides some advanced features such as animation, easing, gradient, and graphic drawing, allowing developers to create more complex user interfaces. There are five categories of widgets, as shown in the figure:
