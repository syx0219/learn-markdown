title: Crowbits-Power Supply(S)
---

## Description
-----------

The power supply is the heart of the Crowbits, The power supply is the power source of the entire Crowbits eco-system and modules, allowing to power them both by battery and power cord connection. On the technical side, the battery is a Lithium battery, the same battery that most of us have inside our phone these days. The voltage of the battery is 3.7V, 3.7 is a bit too much for our use case and the CrowBits, in order to protect them we step down using a module called DC-DC regulator from 3.7V to 3.3V - this allows us to power on the Crowbits safety. The power supply module is rechargeable, it can be charged by a 5V/1A power adapter through a micro USB interface.
