## Usage
-----

1\. You also need to prepare a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply, and an output module, such as Crowbits-LED.

2\. The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.

3\. Then, turn on the power.

- When you place the sensor in a place with strong light, the LED connected behind will not light.

- when you place the sensor in a place with weak light, the LED connected behind will light up.
