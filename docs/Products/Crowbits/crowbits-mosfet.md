title: Crowbits-MOSFET
---

## Description
-----------

The MOSFET is a digital output module, itâ€™s a kind of switch that enables you to control large current with small current.

## Features
--------

- A small current to control large currents

## Specification
-------------

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V DC
- Supply mode: Crowbits Power Module
- Dimensions: 31.5(L)\*24.5(W)\*13(H) mm

## Usage
-----

1.Control fan with relay

1)You also need a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply; An input module, such as Crowbits-Switch; An extension module, such as Crowbits-Terminal.

2)The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.

3)We need to connect the S\_IN interface on the Crowbits-MOSFET board to a 3.3V power supply. So, we connect the VCC interface on Crowbits-terminal board to the S\_IN Interface on Crowbits-MOSFET board with Dupont line.

4)We need to connect the fan's negative pole on the GND interface on the Crowbits-MOSFET board, the positive pole of the fan on the D\_OUT Interface on Crowbits-MOSFET board.

5)Then, turn on the power. When you press the self-locking switch, the small fan starts to turn. When you release the self-locking switch, the small fan stops to turn.
