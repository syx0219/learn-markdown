title: Crowbits-Logic AND
---

## Description
-----------

The logic AND is a logic gate that creates rules for your circuit, gives you more ability to create interesting and complex interactions..The logic AND has two inputs and one output, only both of the inputs are true, the output is true. The interface of the logic AND is a digital interface, it will output a logic-high/low (1/0) signal.

## Features
--------

- Dual input port.
- Single output port.
- Output indicator.

## Specification
-------------

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V DC
- Supply mode: Crowbits Power Module
- Dimensions: 56(L)\*31(W)\*13(H) mm

## Usage
-----

1\) You also need a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply; An input module, such as Crowbits-Switch and Crowbits-Touch Sensor; An extension module, such as Crowbits-LED.

2\) The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.
