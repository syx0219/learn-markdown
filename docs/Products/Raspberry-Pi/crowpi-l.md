Connect camera and microphone via USB, if there is abnormal, you need to first check whether the USB adapter is properly connected in the forth step of the "Raspberry Pi Installation and Booting" operation guide.  

#### **Use of wireless mouse**

1.Take out the wireless receiver in the mouse compartment.   
2.Insert the receiver into the USB port of the Raspberry Pi.   
3.Turn on the power of the mouse to start normal use.   
<font color="blue">Note: Your operation should follow the order above, don't turn on the power first.</font>

#### **Use of touchpad**

When CrowPi-L is working normally, press **FN+F1** to unlock the touchpad for normal use, and press **FN+F1** again to disable the touchpad function. 

#### **Connect to the network**

Insert the network cable into the network port of the Raspberry Pi or turn on the wireless network switch to connect to the wireless network.

#### **Screen brightness adjustment**

When CrowPi-L is working normally, press **F9** to decrease the brightness and press **F10** to increase the brightness.

#### **Charging and battery**

When using the type-c power supply, the battery can be charged. It takes 3 hours to fully charge the battery when it is not working. After being fully charged, it can support the device to work continuously for 3 hours.

#### **Dual system switch**

The self-developed dual-system switching adapter board allows two TF cards to be inserted at the same time, and users can quickly switch the system through the switch on the switching board.  
<font color="blue">Note: Switch operation need to do when machine is turned off, and turn on the laptop after switching successfully.</font>  

#### **Support external storage**

The product provides an independent memory card interface, and users can connect an external memory card to expand the memory capacity.#### Use of expansion screen

CrowPi-L has set aside a standard HDMI interface for customers to use the expansion screen.   
<font color="blue">Note: Affected by the Raspberry Pi 4B hardware, the expansion screen needs to be connected to the HDMI cable and screen before the Raspberry Pi is turned on, and the expansion screen can be used normally after turning on the device.</font>

### **Usage of Pi Panel Software**

After installing the CrowPi L accessories and SD card, and making sure that the SD card switch is turned to the side of the system you need to boot, you can turn on the CrowPi L by pressing the power button.   
![CrowPiL pipanel.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/7/71/CrowPiL_pipanel.png){ loading=lazy }   
![CrowPiL pipanel2.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/2/22/CrowPiL_pipanel2.png){ loading=lazy }   
Once powered on, Pi Panel, the course software we designed, will automatically turn on. If you turn off the software, you can open it again by clicking the icon in the menu at the bottom of the desktop.  
![CrowPiL pipanel3.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/c/c5/CrowPiL_pipanel3.png){ loading=lazy }
![CrowPiL pipanel4.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/b/bf/CrowPiL_pipanel4.png){ loading=lazy }   
In Pi Panel software, there are Letscode lessons and Python lessons in the upper left corner. Letscode is a graphical programming software similar to Scratch which is designed by Elecrow, you don't need to write code, but drag and drop the code blocks to build the program, which is suitable for the beginners to learn.In Python lessons, you need to write code, which is suitable for people who have the basic knowledge of programming. You can learn letscode course first and then learn python course.   
![CrowPiL pipanel5.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/3/38/CrowPiL_pipanel5.png){ loading=lazy }   
There are projects in the upper right corner of the software, there are programs that have already been written and can run directly. Other icons are some program software.   
First of all, let's demonstrate the letscode lessons, click to enter the letscode lessons. The first entrance is for small game writing tutorial, the second is hardware control tutorial, you need to use with crowdtail kit, the third entrance is to add your own tutorials.  
![CrowPiL pipanel6.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/f/f4/CrowPiL_pipanel6.png){ loading=lazy }  
Click into the tutorials to start learning, each lesson has detailed steps. Here take the first lesson of hardware control as an example.   
![CrowPiL pipanel7.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/f/f6/CrowPiL_pipanel7.png){ loading=lazy }   
Enter the course to learn, first it will introduce the letscode software, and then introduce the hardware used in this course.   
![CrowPiL pipanel8.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/1/18/CrowPiL_pipanel8.png){ loading=lazy }   
The first lesson blinking LED, the course will introduce principle of LED lighting, and then introduce the software writing method. According to the step by step guide, click on the run icon after building the program, then we can see the led blinking up as expected.   
![CrowPiL pipanel9.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/c/c3/CrowPiL_pipanel9.png){ loading=lazy }  
![CrowPiL pipanel10.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/d/db/CrowPiL_pipanel10.png){ loading=lazy }    
![CrowPiL pipanel11.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/f/ff/CrowPiL_pipanel11.png){ loading=lazy }     
Then look at the python lessons, the editor used is thonny IDE, the content of the course is similar to the letscode course, but the code writing part is different, here we need to follow the instructions, and then type the code in thonny IDE.   
![CrowPiL pipanel12.png](https://wiki.elecrow.com/images/a/a0/CrowPiL_pipanel12.png){ loading=lazy }   
That's all for the introduction of Pi Panel software.   
Turn off the Pi Panel software, you can use CrowPi L as a laptop, such as open the browser to surf the Internet, open the terminal to run commands, manage your files and so on. You can figure out the other functions and start learning journey by yourself.

The USB adapter connection is unstable, please re-plug

**6. Unable to connect to the network**   
Please turn on the wireless network or connect to the Raspberry Pi Ethernet port.

**7. How to show battery status in the system tray of the native Raspberry Pi OS**   
Here's a little app to show the battery status: [https://github.com/ppyne/crowPi-L\_BatteryStatus](https://github.com/ppyne/crowPi-L_BatteryStatus)For details, please refer to [this page](https://forum.elecrow.com/discussion/295/show-battery-status-of-crowpi-l-in-raspberry-pi-os#latest).
