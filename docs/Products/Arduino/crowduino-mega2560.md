title: Crowduino Mega2560

## Introduction
------------

Elecrow Crowduino Mega2560 board, almost the same usage and performance with the Arduino Mega2560 but with some difference on the power circuit to ensure the power. Based on the ATmega2560. The Elecrow Mega2560 has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. With more IOs and larger flash than the Crowduino Uno\_SD or Crowduino 328, the Crowduino Mega2560 would be helpful in applications that needs more IOs or larger flash such as in 3D printer projects. It also comes with a type-B USB wire to enable you start the project once you get it in hand.
