title: Crowtail- Sound Sensor
---

## Description
-----------

Crowtail- Sound Sensor can detect the sound loudness of the environment. The main component of the module is a simple microphone to receive the sound signal, with band pass filter and a LMV358 amplifier to make the output signal easy to be received by microprocessor. This module outputs analog signal that shows the relative loudness. Besides, an on-board potentiometer can be used to adjust output voltage.

## Features
--------

- Easy to use sound sensor module
- Provides analog output signal

## Specifications
--------------

- Operating voltage : 5V
- Operating current (Vcc=5V): 4-8mA
- Dimensions(mm):20.0(L)x20.0(W)x9.4(H)

## Usage
-----

Turning on a LED by Sound (Sound Sensor)

This example program shows how to use the sound sensor (microphone. When the incoming sound amplitude exceeds a threshold, we will turn an LED on for 1 second.

1.When using the module in conjunction with an Arduino or a Crowduino, use the Crowtail - Base Shield and connect the Crowtail - Sound Sensor module to the shield using a designated Crowdtail Interface. Also attach an output module such as a Crowtail - LED which will get triggered based on input received from the sound sensor (shown below).

2.Upload the following sample sketch to make the LED turn ON and OFF based on input from the sound sensor:

```
/*
   Sound Sensor
   A simple program demonstrate sound sensor senses a sound that is up to the threshold you set 
   in the code, the LED is on for 1s.
*/ 
const int SOUND_SENSOR=A0Â ;         /* sound sensor pin */          
const int  LED=5;          /* LED pin D5*/
#define THRESHOLD_VALUE    300        
#define ON                 HIGH                    /* led on */
#define OFF                LOW                     /* led off */
#define handle_led(x)     digitalWrite(LED, x)    /* handle led */
/* Global Variables */
int sound_value = 0;
void setup() { 
  /* Initialize led pin */
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);  
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
} 
void loop() {  
 /* read the sound value */
  sound_value = analogRead(SOUND_SENSOR);         
  /* if the value is larger than threshold, turn on led */
  if(sound_value > THRESHOLD_VALUE) {
      handle_led(ON); 
      delay(1000);
  }
  handle_led(OFF);
}
```

3.Make a noice and you will see the LED lights up.
