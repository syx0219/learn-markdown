title: LR1302 LoRaWAN HAT for RPI PRD
---

## Description
-----------

The LR1302 LoRaWAN HAT is a Raspberry Pi expansion board that connects the SX1302-based LR1302 LoRaWAN gateway module to a Raspberry Pi (up to Raspberry Pi 5). It also integrates a GPS module and RTC real-time clock to improve the timing and positioning accuracy of the LR1302 module.

In addition to supporting the mini-PCIe form factor of the LR1302 gateway module, the LR1302 LoRaWAN HAT for RPI automatically configures the standard 52-pin gold finger to the Raspberry Pi GPIO connector with a 40-pin compatible header. This simplifies the development process for users to integrate with Raspberry Pi, making it easier to add LR1302 functionality to Raspberry Pi. In addition, it comes with a cooling fan that can effectively dissipate heat for the Raspberry Pi and improve the performance of the Raspberry Pi.

By using the LR1302 LoRaWAN HAT with the LR1302 Gateway Module and a Raspberry Pi, users can build a complete and compact LoRaWAN wireless communication gateway. The SX1302 chip of LR1302 gateway module supports LoRaWAN and LoRa protocols, which enable wireless transmission over long distances.

It provides reliable communication solutions for smart agriculture, smart cities and other IoT scenarios.
