title: Crowbits-Logic NOT
---

## Description
-----------

The logic NOT is a logic gate that uses one input signal to control one output signal, it creates rules for your circuit. The interface of the logic NOT is a digital interface, it will output a logic-high or low (1 or 0) signal.The logic NOT has one input and one output, the output does a reverse operation on the input, which means if you send a logic-high signal to the input, the logic NOT will output a logic-low signal.

-------------

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V DC
- Supply mode: Crowbits Power Module
- Dimensions: 31.5(L)\*24.5(W)\*13(H) mm

## Usage
-----

1)You also need a power module, such as Crowbits-Power Supply; An input module, such as Crowbits-Touch Sensor and Crowbits-Logic NOT; An extension module, such as Crowbits-LED.

2)The connection mode is shown in the figure, but the signal feet of the input module and the output module must be connected.
