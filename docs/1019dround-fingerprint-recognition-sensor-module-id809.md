title: 1019DRound fingerprint recognition sensor module ID809
---

## Description
-----------

This round fingerprint module takes ID809 high-performance processor and semiconductor fingerprint sensor as the core runs the new IDfinger6.0 fingerprint algorithm, which can realize fingerprint registration, comparison, deletion functions ,and colorful lighting effects. And the integrated chip also reduces the volume of the fingerprint module.

The product structure is simple, and the modular design improves the stability and consistency of the product. The fingerprint sensor module supports UART communication mode and with the SDK development kit, it can be connected to any microcontroller or system using a TTL serial, which is convenient for secondary development. It also comes with a 6-pin Molex style 1mm pitch connector that you can easily cut and solder directly to the wires.
